On September 9th, CS Women kicked off the 2014-2015 academic year with an ice cream social. Over 30 people attended, including undergraduate students, graduate students, post-doctorate researchers, and faculty.


Attendees enjoyed a variety of snacks, ice creams, Popsicles, and dairy-free alternatives as both new and seasoned members of the CS Department mingled, making new friends and acquaintances. Pictures of the event are coming soon!
