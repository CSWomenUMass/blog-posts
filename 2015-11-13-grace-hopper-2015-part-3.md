Here are some final remarks from this year's GHC attendees. 

1) List the session you attended.

*Tian*: Career fairs, CRA-W early career workshop series, speed mentoring and Sheryl Sandberg Talk. 

2) Describing what you found most helpful.

*Tian*: The career fairs are useful for finding an Engineering internship; not as useful for finding research internship or (full time job). 


3) A paragraph on a particular session that inspired you.

*Tian*: Sheryl Sandberg talk about gender equality and the stereotypes that are deep down in people mind. 

*Shiri*: The Mentor's Call - A Heroic response to women leaving technology, which explored and redefined the "Heroine's Journey" by reclaiming strong female roles in response to challenges.

5) Any ideas/events/etc. that you would like to see CS Women do as a result of this event.

*Tian*: CS Women are already doing a lot cool events :) I havenâ€™t seen the mentor program for a while and I think it would be great to have it back. But again, it could be that I did not pay enough attention to this program.
